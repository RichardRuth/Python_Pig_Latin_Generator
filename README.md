# Python_Pig_Latin_Generator

This Python program was created for a class assignment for my Python class at Santa Fe College.

The purpose of the program is to take a random sentence inputted by the user, and convert it into a silly "pig latin" sentence per the rules highlighted in the program comments.

This program utilized concepts of string splitting and incrementing through characters of a string, and then concatenating and outputing a different variation of the string.

This program passed all project rules and tests, and received a passing score of 100%.
